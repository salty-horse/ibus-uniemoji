# 0.3.0 — 2015-06-15

- Fuzzy search
- Use system default keyboard layout/variant
  (Actually that's a lie! That's what IBus calls the option, but in reality
  what it does is keep the previous layout/variant when you switch. So if
  you're coming from a qwerty IM to uniemoji, you'll get qwerty; if you're
  coming from a dvorak IM, you get dvorak, and so on.)

# 0.2.0 — 2015-04-06
